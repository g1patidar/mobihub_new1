            The first Shopify store <br />

          </h1>
          <p>
            Over a decade ago, we started a store to sell to sell snowboards
            online. None of the ecommerce solutions at the time gave us the
            control we needed to be successful—so we built our own.Today,
            businesses of all sizes use Shopify, whether they're selling online,
            in retail stores, or on-the-go.{" "}
